OOD-aware Hierarchical Gradient Boosting (OOD-HGB) framework that generates synthetic OOD data using a VAE-based generative model. This synthetic OOD data mimics the properties of ID data, providing far more realistic OOD samples. Our proposed framework utilizes a Hierarchical Gradient Boosting model which operates in two stages: in the first stage, the model identifies whether the input is ID or OOD; in the second stage, it classifies the ID data into specific structural damage categories.

This approach enhances system efficiency and adaptability, making it well-suited for real-world applications. The OOD detection performance of the framework is evaluated by distinguishing OOD samples from both far-OOD (samples that lie far from the training distribution) and near-OOD (samples that are more challenging to detect due to their proximity to ID data).
